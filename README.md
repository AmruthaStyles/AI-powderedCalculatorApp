# AI - Canvas

This project is an AI-powered calculator app that can solve complex mathematical problems, detect abstract concepts in drawings, and even understand the meaning behind symbols like Captain America's shield.

*Features*

* *Basic Arithmetic:* Performs simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* *Complex Equations:* Solves complex equations and mathematical expressions.
* *Abstract Concept Detection:* Understands and interprets abstract concepts depicted in drawings.
* *Latex Rendering:* Displays mathematical expressions in a clear and readable format using LaTeX.
* *Drag and Drop:* Allows users to move the rendered LaTeX expressions around the screen.

*Technologies Used*

* *Frontend:* React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shaden, Mantine
* *Backend:* FastAPI, Python, Google AI Gemini
* *Other:* XS, MathJax

*Getting Started*

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/amruthhareddy/ai-canvas.git
   
2. *Install Dependencies:*
   bash
   cd ai-calculator-app
   npm install
   
3. *Start the Development Server:*
   bash
   npm run dev
   
4. *Run the Backend Server:*
   bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd backend

   # Create a virtual environment and activate it
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Run the server
   python main.py
   

*How to Use*

1. *Draw:* Use your mouse or stylus to draw mathematical expressions or diagrams on the canvas.
2. *Calculate:* Click the "Calculate" button to trigger the AI model to process the drawing.
3. *View Results:* The app will display the calculated result in LaTeX format.
4. *Drag and Drop:* Move the rendered LaTeX expressions around the screen.
